**Metrics & KPI Definitions**

**Singapore HDB Resale Price Analysis (2017–2024)**

**Purpose**

This document defines all key metrics and KPIs used in the analysis and Power BI dashboard, including:

●	Calculation logic

●	Business rationale

●	Interpretation guidelines

The goal is to ensure clarity, consistency, and correctness across Python, SQL, and Power BI.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**Core Price Metrics**

**1️.Median Resale Price**

Definition: The median resale transaction price within a selected filter context.

Formula: Median(resale_price)

Why Median?

●	Resale prices are right-skewed

●	Median reduces distortion from extreme high-value transactions

●	Provides a more representative market benchmark

Used In:

●	KPI cards

●	Trend analysis

●	Town and flat-type comparisons

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**2.Average Price per Sqft**

Definition:  Average resale price normalized by floor area.

Formula: resale_price / sqft

Rationale:

●	Allows fair comparison across different flat sizes

●	More stable distribution than absolute resale price

Used In:

●	KPI cards

●	Town and flat-type efficiency analysis

Growth & Trend Metrics

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**3.Year-over-Year (YoY) Growth %**

Definition: Percentage change in median resale price compared to the previous year.

Formula: (Median Price (Current year) − Median Price (previous year)) / Median Price (previous year)

Key Notes:

●	Calculated on median values (not averages)

●	Negative YoY indicates market normalization, not collapse

●	Sensitive to transaction volume

Used In:

●	KPI cards

●	Trend visuals

●	Conditional formatting indicators

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**4.Total Transactions**

Definition: Total number of resale transactions within a given period.

Formula: COUNT(resale transactions)

Rationale:

●	Provides market activity context

●	Explains volatility in YoY growth

Used In:

●	KPI cards

●	Column charts alongside YoY growth

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**Age & Condition Metrics**

**5.Flat Age**

Definition: Approximate age of the flat at the time of resale.

Formula:Transaction Year − Lease Commencement Year

Usage:

●	Age-based analysis

●	Value retention calculations

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**6.Flat Condition**

Definition: Categorical classification of flats based on age.

Condition

New	-> 0–10 years

Mid-aged -> 11–30 years

Old -> 31+ years

Rationale:

●	Simplifies non-linear age-price relationships

●	Improves dashboard interpretability

**Structural & Location Metrics**

**7.Floor Rise Category**

Definition: Categorization of floor level based on quantiles of average storey height.

Category	

Low	-> 0- 5

Mid -> 6-9	

High -> 10 and above

Rationale:

●	Avoids arbitrary floor cutoffs

●	Enables fair cross-town comparison

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**Advanced Analytical Metrics**

**8.Value Retention Index**

Definition: Measures how well older flats retain value relative to newer flats.

Formula: Median Price (Flat Age 30–40) ÷ Median Price (Flat Age 0–5)

Interpretation:

●	1.0 → Older flats outperform newer flats

●	< 1.0 → Value declines with age

●	Higher index = better long-term value retention

Used In:

●	Flat-type comparison

●	Long-term investment insights

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**Interpretation Guidelines**

●	All KPIs respond dynamically to slicers (year, town, flat type)

●	Median-based KPIs should not be compared directly with mean-based statistics

●	YoY growth should always be interpreted alongside transaction volume

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**Summary**

These metrics were designed to:

●	Minimize distortion from outliers

●	Reflect true market behavior

●	Support business and policy-level decision-making

●	Enable clear, explainable dashboard storytelling
