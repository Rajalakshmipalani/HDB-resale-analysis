**Market-Level Insights**

**1. HDB Resale Prices Have Accelerated Post-2020**
   
●	Median resale prices show strong growth after 2020

●	Growth is not uniform year-on-year, indicating volatility rather than linear appreciation

●	YoY growth spikes coincide with lower transaction volumes

Implication: Price trends must always be interpreted alongside transaction volume to avoid misleading conclusions.

**2. Median Price Is a More Reliable Market Indicator Than Average**
   
●	Resale price distribution is right-skewed

●	High-value transactions distort averages

●	Median provides a stable and representative signal

Implication: All KPIs and growth metrics are median-based for accuracy and interpretability.

**Flat Characteristics & Pricing Drivers**

**3.Flat Size Strongly Influences Resale Price, But Not Value Efficiency**

●	Larger flats (4- and 5-room) command higher absolute prices

●	However, price per sqft varies significantly across towns and flat types

Implication: Absolute price alone is insufficient; standardized metrics are required for fair comparison.

**4.Higher Floors Generally Command a Price Premium**

●	Median resale prices increase with floor level

●	Premium magnitude varies by town and flat type

Implication: Floor rise categorization improves interpretability and enables controlled comparisons.

**Age & Long-Term Value**

**5.Flat Age Has a Non-Linear Impact on Resale Price**

●	Prices decline as flats age

●	Early-age depreciation is steeper

●	Price decline flattens for older flats

Implication: Age bucketing (New / Mid / Old) provides clearer insights than continuous age analysis.

**6.Larger Flats Retain Value Better Over Time**

●	Larger flat types show slower depreciation

●	Smaller flats experience sharper early declines

Implication: Value retention differs structurally by flat type and should not be generalized.

**7.Value Retention Index Highlights Long-Term Resilience**

●	Comparing newer and older flats reveals significant differences in retention

●	Some flat types retain a larger proportion of their original value

Implication: The Value Retention Index provides a long-term lens beyond short-term price movements.

**Location-Based Insights**

**8.Significant Town-Level Price Disparities Exist**

●	Mature towns dominate top median resale prices

●	Town-level differences persist even after controlling for flat type

Implication: Geographic segmentation is essential for meaningful analysis.

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**Market Activity & Volatility**

**9.Transaction Volume Explains YoY Volatility**

●	Years with lower transaction counts exhibit higher YoY volatility

●	Negative YoY growth often reflects normalization rather than decline

Implication: YoY growth must always be contextualized with volume metrics.

**Summary of Strategic Insights**

●	Median-based analysis improves robustness

●	Structural factors (size, age, floor) dominate pricing behavior

●	Market activity strongly influences short-term volatility

●	Long-term value retention varies meaningfully across flat types and locations

Conclusion
This analysis provides a balanced view of short-term market dynamics and long-term structural value, supporting informed interpretation of HDB resale prices for analytical and decision-making purposes.
